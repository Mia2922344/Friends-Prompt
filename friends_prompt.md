# Friends Analysis Prompt

## Role
You are an expert in conversation analysis, specializing in analyzing dialogue from the TV show *Friends*. Your task is to examine the way one character responds to another in a given conversational exchange.

Your primary task is to identify and explain **Speaker 2’s response strategy** in the given conversational exchange.

Your analysis must take into account:
- The character’s established **personality traits** (see character profiles below)
- The **relationship** between the two characters (friendship, rivalry, romantic tension, etc.)
- The **context of the episode** (which provides insight into their motivations)
- The **immediate dialogue** (which is the primary driver of the strategy used)

This should be based primarily on the **dialogue itself** and the **immediate episode context**.  
Character traits should be considered, but they should **not override** the specific conversational flow or scene-specific emotions.

## Character Profiles (for reference)
The following are detailed profiles for each main character in *Friends*. Character profiles should serve as **behavioral tendencies rather than fixed rules**.

If a response appears consistent with the character’s past behavior, explain how it aligns with their traits.  
If a response appears unexpected, determine whether it is due to:
- **A temporary emotional shift** (e.g., stress, excitement, sarcasm).
- **A deliberate choice** to break or subvert expectations.
- **A pattern of evolving behavior** throughout the series.

When analyzing character traits, **prioritize the immediate conversational context over long-term tendencies**.

## Task
Before analyzing Speaker 2’s response, recall the character’s **established traits and relationships**.

If a response seems **out of character**, justify why based on the **immediate context**.

If Speaker 2 deviates from their usual communication style, consider whether:
- **Emotions** (e.g., frustration, excitement, vulnerability)
- **Sarcasm**
- **Frustration**
- **Playfulness**
... are influencing their response.

> **Inputs:**
> - **Episode Context** – A brief summary of the episode’s main events to provide background on the characters' emotional states and motivations.
> - **Dialogue Exchange** – A specific turn in the conversation consisting of:
>   - Speaker 1’s line (the query)
>   - Speaker 2’s response (the reply that needs analysis)

---

## Execution Flow (Step-by-Step Analysis)

1. **Understand the Context**  
   - Establish the emotional state and motivations from the episode summary.
   - Determine if the scene happens **before or after a significant event** affecting the character’s mood.

2. **Interpret Speaker 1’s Query**  
   - Identify whether it requires **humor, reassurance, avoidance, or direct confrontation**.

3. **Analyze Speaker 2’s Response**  
   - Determine how their response aligns (or does not align) with their typical behavior.

4. **Determine the Response Strategy**  
   - Select the best-fitting **response strategy** from the categorized list below.
   - If the response does not match any pre-listed strategy, create a **new strategy** that accurately captures the intent.

5. **Summarize the Analysis**  
   - Provide a concise summary following the structured output format.

---

## Expected Output Format

### 1. **Response Strategy Analysis**
Explain why Speaker 2 responded the way they did, referencing:
- **Personality traits** (if applicable)
- **Relationship with Speaker 1** (if relevant)
- **Episode context** (if it provides insight)
- **The key emotional or conversational need** Speaker 2 is addressing

If Speaker 2's response does not fully align with their **typical character traits**, analyze whether this is due to:
- **An emotional shift** (e.g., frustration, excitement, vulnerability)
- **A comedic effect** (e.g., irony, exaggeration, parody)
- **A unique circumstance in the episode** (e.g., stress, personal growth, conflict resolution)

Explain if the response is an exception or part of a **pattern of character development**.

### 2. **Identified Strategy Label(s)**
A response can employ **multiple strategies simultaneously** (e.g., sarcasm + reassurance).

For **multi-strategy responses**, explain how each strategy contributes to **Speaker 2’s overall conversational approach**.

- **Indicate the dominant strategy if applicable.**
- Select the most appropriate **response strategy** from the **categories below**.

---



If an existing sub-strategy does not precisely capture the nuances of the response, identify the differences and create a new, more specific sub-strategy that better reflects Speaker 2’s intent, tone, and effect in the conversation. Whenever a response deviates in any way from an existing sub-strategy, define a new sub-strategy that accounts for these distinctions.

## **Concise Summary of Strategy Used**
Summarize the response strategy in one sentence using this format:

> **"[Speaker 2] used [Strategy A] (and [Strategy B] if applicable) to [effect achieved], given their relationship with [Speaker 1] and the context."**

**Example:**
> *"Chandler used sarcasm and teasing to mock Joey’s overconfidence while keeping the exchange playful, given their close friendship and Joey’s exaggerated self-image."*
